TODO 
    - Update frontend for mobile
    - Make "logo" in the side bar
    - move sidebar to top? 

    - add functions to the new modes
    - images in result
    - search a vps (no need for db)
    - It literally doesn't check for errors
        - IT WILL BREAK if you try to use: empty watchlists, invalid users!
